# pairwise-mvn
An R implementation of Yuan, Lambert & Fouladi's (2004) method for assessing multivariate normality with missing data. The input is assumed to be a list of raw data matrices (each column a variable and each row a participant). Presently this requires that at least one column in each group be complete, i.e. not have any data missing.
