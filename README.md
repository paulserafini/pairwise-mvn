# pairwise-mvn
An R implementation of Yuan, Lambert & Fouladi's (2004) method for assessing multivariate normality with missing data. The input is assumed to be a list of raw data matrices (each column a variable and each row a participant). Presently, to assess that the missing scores do not sit in a restricted range---an assumption of the check of multivariate normality---one column must be complete, i.e. without missing data.
